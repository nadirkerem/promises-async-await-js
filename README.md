# Promises, Async/Await Lab

## Overview

This repository contains a JavaScript project designed to demonstrate the use of Promises and Async/Await patterns in managing asynchronous operations effectively. Developed as part of the Per Scholas Software Engineering Program, this lab focuses on real-world application scenarios to fetch and manipulate user data from multiple simulated databases.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Database Routing**: Uses a central function to determine which database should be queried based on user ID.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Implements asynchronous API calls to fetch user data from multiple sources using both `Promise` and `async/await` patterns.
- **Error Handling**: Integrates robust error handling to manage invalid input and fetch errors, ensuring the stability of data retrieval operations.

## Installation

To set up this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Since this project uses ES Modules in the browser, you can open the index.html directly in a modern web browser that supports modules, or serve the directory using a local server if your browser restricts module scripts on file URLs.

## Usage

Open index.html in your web browser to execute the JavaScript code.

The web page will interact with the simulated databases and display data based on predefined user IDs, showcasing how the application handles asynchronous operations and error scenarios.
